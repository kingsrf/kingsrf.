My personal repository

CS student. My ambition is to become a skilled and impactful engineer in the field.

In my free time, I love playing chess, racing go-karts, making music, and playing soccer. Lately, I've been having a lot of interest in fishing, and I also have a passion for travelingâ€”especially when there's a great air flight deal.

Let's connect and build something amazing together!
